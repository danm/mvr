# mvr
Minimal viable repo for managing multiple projects

Mono is cool again, and not just the mono repo. Writing your stack in a single language rather than it being a Polyglot (multi-language) has so many benifits in designing, writing and releasing quality software fast. The first hurdle you have to get over, however, is the rule use the best tool for the job.

For example, use the screwdriver from the tool box rather than the one from your Swiss Army knife. And I largely agree, the grip is better, there is less risk in threading the screw. But the toolbox box is in the loft, its kinda rusty and a bit of a pain to open. Whereas, my Swiss Army knife is in my pocket and is easy to open. I only have a couple of screws to remove, so I'm going to go against "best tool for the job", and use the one that will completed the task the queickest.

MVR is about the calculation of deciding whether to use the toolbox or the swiss army knife, easier.

Just like the Swiss Army knife, MVR is opinionated.

- Front end components use React + CSS-in-JS
- Server components are microservices running in containers 
- Everything is writen in typescript
- Everything is tested with Jest
- Everything is styled according to AirBnb code guidelines
- Everything is built using GitHub actions
- Everything is packaged and versioned
- Everything is maintained by Pnpm workspace tools

These rules take away any eco system decisions, and instead just write code to solve problems, really quickly.
